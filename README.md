Green house is a concept, build for demonstration purposes, it is composed by:

- 2x [humidity sensors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167)
- 1x [servo](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065)
- 2x fan
- 1x [lcd screen](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/790)
- 1x [gas sensor - not these but similar](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9404)
- 1x [keypad](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8653)
- 1x [GSM cellural shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/9607)
- 1x arduino uno
- 1x raspbery pi 1
- ?x leds for watering lines

It can:

- input operating limits from keypad
- measure humidity in two seperate lines of watering
- decide if its cold or warm, and open or close heater
- open windows when there is fire, close them afterwards
- clear the air
- sent measurements over serial
- provide realtime measurements
- provide realtime status of sensors
- inform you about the current sensor metrics with SMS!
